        <p>StorBox places great emphasis on your privacy. If you do not share files or file links, others cannot view the files you have saved in StorBox. Even StorBox developers cannot view the data in the files you have saved. When you turn to developers for technical support, they can only access the metadata (such as file names and locations).
		</p>
		<p>We have adopted several measures to ensure your privacy.
		<ul>
			<li>Network isolation<p>The network planes on which the administrator and you reside are isolated from each other. The administrator cannot access the network on which you save files.
</p></li>
			<li>Slice-based data storage<p>After object data is sliced, data slices are stored on disks of different storage nodes randomly based on a distributed hash algorithm. Malicious users cannot obtain user data from a single storage node or disk. When the lifecycle of a service ends or a user stops using a service, the slice-based data storage technology supports secure data destruction, preventing data leak.</p></li>
			<li>User data isolation<p>Each user owns independent logical space and follows unique storage policies. Data of one user is isolated from that of another user, ensuring data security and privacy.</p></li>
			<li>Encrypted storage of sensitive user data<p>Sensitive and private user data, such as authentication information and email addresses, is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm before being stored.</p></li>

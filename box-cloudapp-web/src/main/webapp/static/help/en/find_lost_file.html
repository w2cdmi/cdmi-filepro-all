            <h1>How Can I Get a Lost File Back?</h1>
            <a class="return" href="helpcenter.html">&lt;&lt;Back to Help Center</a>
        </div> 
		<p>A file may get lost due to many factors. You can get a lost file back by performing the following steps:
		<ul>
		  <li>Check whether the file is shared with other users.<p>If the file disappears, the file sharer has removed you from the recipients or the sharer has deleted the shared file or has canceled the share. Contact the sharer to confirm the reason.</p></li>
		  <li>Locate the file by searching for it.<p>Log in to StorBox website, and enter the name of the lost file in the search field. You may find that the file has been moved to another location.</p></li>
		  <li>Check the recycle bin for the file.
		    <p>If a file is deleted mistakenly, you can log in to StorBox website and check the recycle bin for the file. If you find the file, you can <a class="green" href="recover_deleted_file.html">recover</a> it to its previous location.</p>
		    <!-- <p>If a file is deleted mistakenly on a terminal device, the same file on other terminals is also deleted because of the synchronization function. You can log in to StorBox website and check the recycle bin for the file. If you find the file, you can <a class="green" href="recover_deleted_file.html">recover</a> it to its previous location.</p><-->
		  </li>
        </ul></p>
		<p>If the previous methods fail, report the problem along with the information about your location (for example, the US or Shenzhen), name of the lost file, creation time, and file type to the technical support engineer. They will help find files.
